Hello!

Been a while since I've uploaded to the Models-Resource, but I wanted to upload some new models.

As with all of my rips, I'd like if you give credit. Some of these models require lots of fixes to get looking good, so I would appreciate if you credited me!

If you want to see more of what I do, please head over to the following sites I visit:

You can also either contact me from those sites above, or send me an email at:

tomixnscale89@gmail.com

or add me on steam

IF YOUR MODEL DOES NOT IMPORT CORRECTLY:

Some models tend to not import correctly in some programs *cough* sketchup *cough*, so try importing the model into Blender first, and try a different format. I used Blender for all of my models, so they should work there.

If you run into more issues, contact me using one of the methods above.

Have fun with the model!
